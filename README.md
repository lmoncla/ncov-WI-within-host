# ncov-WI-within-host

Analysis of within-host sequence data generated by Katarina Braun and Gage Moreno, from SARS-CoV2 patients sampled in Wisconsin. 

The goal of this project is to characterize within-host diversity during acute SARS-CoV2 infection. Gage and Kat and have sequenced 142 samples collected from SARS-CoV2 infected individuals in Wisconsin, USA, including a set of 25 households for which samples from multiple individuals were taken. All 142 samples were sequenced in duplicate. 

This repository contains scripts for reading in intersection vcfs (vcfs containing only variants that were identified in both biological sequencing replicates) and summarizing patterns of within-host variation. There are also scripts to query whether variants detected within-host are present in the global phylogeny and to quantify aspects of within-host variant transmission. 

Individuals are welcome to borrow and use this code if it is helpful, just let me know what you are up to.
